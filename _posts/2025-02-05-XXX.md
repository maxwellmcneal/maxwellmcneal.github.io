On December 14th, 2024, Travis Hunter won the Heisman Trophy, the award for the best player in college football that year. On April 24th, at the 2025 NFL draft, we are going to hear his name get called, and watch the most dynamic two-way player since Deion Sanders, his college coach, get drafted. His skills on both sides of the ball make him an absolute outlier in modern football.

Most NFL players live on either offense or defense. But, it wasn't always this way. The one-platoon system, where the same players played both offense and defense, was the standard in the NFL until 1943 due to rules requiring players to sit for the rest of the half or quarter if they came out of the game. With the implementation of unlimited substitutions in 1943, teams rapidly realized how beneficial it was to have specialized players for offense and defense.

Now, football has evolved into a game of hyper-specialization. On offense, only specific players are allowed to catch a forward pass, lest they suffer an illegal touching penalty. On defense, linebackers are frequently pulled off the field in favor of another defensive back to better defend the offensive personnel. Each position has a strictly defined set of rules and responsibilites. And, unlike most other sports, there is a group of players, linemen, who are never intended to touch the football. Fans, broadcasters, and fellow players alike celebrate when big men get the football and start [rumbling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3N2hLorjns) [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCa3YMd7f88) [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jiu52DN8vYA) [field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGI4wbgyyoQ), in part because of how rare and almost unnatural it seems. This compelled me to ask the question: Who has had the best career in the NFL without ever holding the football?

## The Rules
First, let me clarify what I mean by "holding the football". I am specifically interested in the best NFL player who never had posession of the football during any of their NFL games. This means they cannot have any passing attempts, rushing attempts, receptions, or yards of any kind, including special teams. Also, they cannot have recovered any fumbles or picked off any passes. As for determining the "best" player out of those who remain, I think using games played as a proxy is helpful. A player who played 10 seasons but never got the ball obviously contributed in many other ways, otherwise they would be out of the league. Statistics won't tell the whole story, especially given offensive lineman's lack of counting stats in a box score, so I will individually investigate the top players after I get my short list of contenders.

Before I dive into the actual data, let's mentally narrow down who is in the running for this award. This immediately disqualifies all offensive players who got the ball, eliminating all quarterbacks, runningbacks, receivers, and tight ends (if they caught a passes). This leaves only offensive linemen and tight ends who never caught a pass, which basically means only offensive linemen. Of course, only offensive linemenwho haven't falled on a fumble either. On the defensive side, it doesn't technically outright eliminate any entire positions. However, it seems like it would eliminate defensive backs and most linebackers. It seems hard to imagine a player in the secondary with no interceptions having a better overall career than a defensive lineman with no fumble recoveries. Lastly, kickers and punters are not eligible. Punters clearly possess the ball prior to punting it, and while it's more gray with kickers, it feels against the spirit of my question.

## The Data
I will be using the dataset outlined in my [last post](https://www.maxwellmcneal.com/2025/01/29/PFR-Scraper.html). It contains the careers statistics of all NFL players in history, scraped from the Pro Football Reference website.

First, I'm going to add some helper columns and combine regular and postseason games played and starts for easier viewing.
```python
player_stats = pd.read_csv('player_stats.csv')

player_stats['career_length'] = player_stats['career_end'] - player_stats['career_begin'] + 1
player_stats['games'] = player_stats['games_reg'] + player_stats['games_post']
player_stats['games_started'] = player_stats['games_started_reg'] + player_stats['games_started_post']
player_stats['start_pct'] = player_stats['games_started'] / player_stats['games']
```
I want to cut all players with any possessions, meaning pass attempts, rush attempts, receptions, kick returns, or punt returns, as well as any interceptions or fumbles recovered, in either the regular season or postseason.
```python
players = player_stats[
    (player_stats['position'] != 'K') &
    (player_stats['position'] != 'P') &
    (player_stats['pass_att_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['pass_att_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rush_att_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rush_att_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rec_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rec_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['def_int_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['def_int_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['fumbles_rec_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['fumbles_rec_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['punt_ret_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['punt_ret_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['kick_ret_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['kick_ret_post'] == 0)
]
```
Finally, I want to sort the resulting players by total games played and display the relevant columns for the top 10 players.
```python
players = players.sort_values(by='games', ascending=False)
players_display = players[['name', 'position', 'height', 'weight', 'career_length', 'games', 'games_started', 'start_pct']]
players_display.head(10)
```

| 10229 | Josh Harris     | LS         | 6-1      | 224lb    |              13 |     216 |               0 |   0         |
|  6469 | Jon Dorenbos    | C          | 6-0      | 250lb    |              14 |     209 |               0 |   0         |
| 16718 | Jake McQuaide   | LS         | 6-2      | 247lb    |              14 |     207 |               0 |   0         |
| 17638 | Mike Morris     | C-G        | 6-5      | 276lb    |              13 |     198 |               0 |   0         |
|  3819 | Joe Cardona     | LS         | 6-2      | 245lb    |              10 |     173 |               0 |   0         |

On first glance, this seems promising. A mix of offensive linemen and tight ends, with a couple long snappers. But looking closer, it's odd that almost none of the top 10 have started a game, except Dale Hellestrae, who seems to be an gadget offensive linemen. Looking at J.J. Jansen's Pro Football Reference [page](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JansJ.00.htm), we find the devil is in the details. Despite being listed as a center in his header, for each season he has played, he is actually been listed as a long snapper. And even worse, everyone else on this list, they're all long snappers as well. I've essentially compiled a list of long snappers who haven't done anything besides long snapping, sorted by games played. Not at all what I wanted. 

Looking further down the list, it seems like the first player who isn't a long snapper on this list is [Tim Ruddy](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RuddTi20.htm). A legitimate center, he played 156 games across 10 years, starting 140 of them, with a Pro Bowl selection in 2000. However, as a center, he has 3 fumbles credited to him due to bad snaps. You can watch one of them [here](https://youtu.be/eIYj9G57P20?t=576). This one specifically looks like it's all on Ruddy to me. When he snaps the ball Marino is looking at the sideline, clearly not expecting the snap. I think for the sake of this question, fumbling the ball means necessitates that you had possession of it, thus eliminating all centers and long snappers seen before. [^1]

The next real offensive lineman seems to be [Rudy Comstock](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ComsRu20.htm). A guard and tackle, he had a 11 year career that spanned 152 games and 127 starts. However, he played in the 1920s and 30s. Individual stat keeping and box scores don't span back that far, so we have no real way of telling if Comstock ever possessed the football on the field or not.

The first defensive player on the list is [Ramon Humber](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HumbRa00.htm). A linebacker who played 148 games and started 30 across 10 years. He racked up 312 combined tackles and 4.5 sacks. But looking at his snaps counts, which PFR has tracked since 2012, he struggled to consistently see the field on defense, with the majority of his snaps coming on special teams. A good career, for sure, but not the caliber of player I thought I would arrive at. And honestly, not a satisfying answer to me. 

### Reconsidering
What if I reconsider my original question? Now that I've seen just how strict my requirements were before, I want to see what kinds of players I get if loosen the standards to see if I can satisfyingly answer this odd question about football players with no football. I think the "no fumble recoveries" requirement is what's eliminating many of the great linemen, both offensive and defensive, throughout NFL history. Fumble recoveries are not exactly a skill, they're more of a right place, right time thing. The more snaps you're on the field for, the more fumbles you'll witness, and the more chances you have to dive on a loose ball at least once in your career. But, I still want to make sure these players don't have any fumble returns, and definitely no scoop and scores. I'm going to rerun this list, but change the no fumble recoveries to no fumble recovery yards. To eliminate all the long snappers, I'm going to also set a requirement that a player's percentage of games started is greater than 50%. Lastly, I'm going to add the requirement of no fumbles, given that we established that a player who fumbles must necessarily have had posession earlier.

```python
players = player_stats[
    (player_stats['position'] != 'K') &
    (player_stats['position'] != 'P') &
    (player_stats['pass_att_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['pass_att_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rush_att_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rush_att_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rec_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['rec_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['def_int_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['def_int_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['fumbles_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['fumbles_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['fumbles_rec_yds_reg'] <= 0) &
    (player_stats['fumbles_rec_yds_post'] <= 0) &
    (player_stats['punt_ret_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['punt_ret_post'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['kick_ret_reg'] == 0) &
    (player_stats['kick_ret_post'] == 0) & 
    (player_stats['start_pct'] > 0.5)
]

I showed the top 15 players by games played instead of 10 this time, as the talent level really doesn't fall off outside the top 10. This list is a veritable Who's Who of excellent offensive linemen. As stated previously, offensive lineman careers are challenging to evaluate solely off statistics, especially for older players. Across this list, there are so many Pro Bowls made, All-Pro teams selected for, and Super Bowls won. Luckily for me, I don't need to try to evaluate and compare these players' careers, as the broader football community has already done this, and chose to give the highest honor to 14 of them. All of the following players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
- Steve Wisniewski
- Larry Allen
- Winston Hill
- Larry Little
- Willie Roaf
- Walter Jones
- Joe Delamielleure
- Orlando Pace
- Dan Hampton
- Jim Langer
- Joe Klecko
- Russ Grimm
- George Trafton
- Art Donovan

[^1]: On top of these fumbles, it seems like Ruddy also has a postgame reception in 1998. Not sure why my scraper missed that one, as Ruddy's postseason targets, receptions, and receiving yards all show as 0 in my dataset. It's certainly something for me to look into, regardless of the fact that he's not our winner for this question.
