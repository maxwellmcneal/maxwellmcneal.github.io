## About Me
I am currently a freelance data analyst. Sports analytics, particularly for football and basketball (college or pro), are what currently interest me the most, though I am open to any data science projects, big or small.
If you want to get in contact with me to discuss one of my blog posts, ask me a question, collaborate on a project, or hire me for consulting work, please reach out to me at [mcnealmaxwell@gmail.com](mailto:mcnealmaxwell@gmail.com).

You can find my github profile [here](https://github.com/maxwellmcneal).
